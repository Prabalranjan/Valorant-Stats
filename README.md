Valorant Stats



Hello everyone. I love playing and analyzing Valorant. So what could be a better than topic than my first data analyst project? Valorant is a 5v5 shooting video game. It has many different guns. In this project, I have analyzed all the guns and tried to answer some burning questions roaming around the gaming community. 
I have downloaded the CSV file from Kaggle - https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/aadhavvignesh/valorant-weapon-stats/code

Used Excel to clean the data and turn it into the appropriate format to analyze. I have used Power Bi as a visualization tool.
Here I have uploaded the power bi file, excel file, and CSV file along with the Project which is in PDF format.


Happy Learning.
